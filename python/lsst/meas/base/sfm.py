r"""Base classes for single-frame measurement plugins and the associated task.

In single-frame measurement, we assume that detection and probably deblending
have already been run on the same frame, so a `~lsst.afw.table.SourceCatalog`
has already been created with `lsst.afw.detection.Footprint`\ s (which may be
"heavy" â€” that is, include pixel data). Measurements are generally recorded in
the coordinate system of the image being measured (and all slot-eligible
fields must be), but non-slot fields may be recorded in other coordinate
systems if necessary to avoid information loss (this should, of course, be
indicated in the field documentation).

    Parameters

        Configuration for this plugin.
    name : `str`
        The string with which the plugin was registered.
